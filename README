TNKernel real-time kernel (version 2.6)


Introduction:
 TNKernel is a compact and very fast real-time kernel for the embedded 32/16 bits microprocessors.
 TNKernel performs a preemptive priority-based scheduling and a round-robin scheduling for the tasks with
identical priority.
 The current version of TNKernel includes semaphores, mutexes, data queues, event flags and fixed-sized
memory pools. The system functions calls in the interrupts are supported.
 TNKernel is a fully portable (written mostly in ANSI C except processor-specific parts).
 TNKernel has been written “under the significant influence” of the μITRON 4.0 Specifications.
 The μITRON 4.0 Specifications is an open real-time kernel specification developed by the ITRON
Committee of the TRON Association.The μITRON 4.0 Specification document can be obtained from
the ITRON Project web site (http://www.assoc.tron.org/eng/document.html).
 TNKernel is distributed in the source code form free of charge under the FreeBSD-like license.

 This is port for YRDKRX62N board. Board contains R5F562N8BDFP, member of Renesas RX600 microcontroller series.
Port was made for vanilla GCC v4.6.2, Binutils v2.21, NewLib v1.19.0.


Features & known limitations:
* OS tick timer ticks with 256 Hz frequency
  (RTC periodic interrupt is used for that purpose, if higher frequency is required - use MTU or CMT).
* Standard output is redirected to SCI2 with baud rate 115200 bps (printf and puts functions are thread safe and block execution till the end of transmission).
* Floating point coprocessor status register is not saved for every task. (Is this required at all?)
* Accumulator value is not saved for every task.
* "Find first set" function is implemented as a loop. Fixed execution time function may be better.
* "-mint-register" compiler option is not interpreted as it should be. Full context (R1-R15) is saved and restored for each task.
